CommandStationGUI
=================

### Recommended Steps

1. Learn how to use [Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)
2. Learn how to write [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python)
2. Install Flask and follow the quickstart tutorial (link below)
3. Once you've done that, read about socket.io (link below) on Python and try implementing your own websocket application using that and Flask
4. If you would like to work on this, but haven't been assigned anything yet, message Shreyas on slack to see how you can help and to get access to the repository (note: this is different then getting access to the organization)

### Workflow
 
1. Clone this repository (HOW: "git clone https://github.com/RUMDLoop/CommandStationGUI")
2. If there is a new feature to be added, or a next step, or a bug, please make an [issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/)
3. Create a new branch in this format: "Name/IS-(Issue Number)", so if I was working on Issue 5, it would be "shreyas/IS-5", if you are just playing around replace the part after the slash with "play", like "shreyas/play". (HOW: "git checkout -b (branch-name)
4. Once you are done and would like to contribute to the master branch, make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). Your code will be reviewed and merged in if it works and is good code
5. Once it has been merged in, delete your branch and repeat this process

### Warnings

* DO NOT PUSH TO MASTER DIRECTLY
* TEST YOUR CODE BEFORE YOU MAKE A PULL REQUEST
